0,daviddiy,5.0,"June 2, 2021",United States,Best iMac so far,"I’m downsizing from a 27in iMac to this 24in and I can hardly tell the difference. Every video I watch on the screen is smooth, vivid, and clear. Due to the new Apple M1 chip, 4K videos play without any lag and no matter how many apps I’m using, this computer doesn’t even stutter. It is amazing how they can fit such a quiet and powerful computer into a body that is as thin as a macbook. Speakers are so small yet they are stronger than previous models. The magic mouse, keyboard, power cable, and included lightning cable are color matched, even the sticker is color matched to your model! I highly recommend getting the 8 core/8 core gpu model as the base model doesn’t come with the touch ID on the keyboard - a very underrated feature. The upgrade from the base model also includes an ethernet jack on the power brick as well as 2 more usb-c jacks in the back. The power button and aux jack are located to the left of the screen on the back and side. This is not just a computer for casual home use, it will function perfectly for the majority of users - person and business. If you are looking for a new Mac, look no further."
1,Nick,1.0,"May 28, 2021",United States,Strong mold smell,Computer had a very strong mold smell due to shipping from China.  This is not the first time Apple IMac has mold smell
2,Linda K.,1.0,"June 6, 2021",United States,Buy your computers from Amazon,"3 weeks after buying this computer I was asked to do an update which on my DSL took 8+hours, After the download I was told to restart after which I was ask things as if I was setting the computer for the first time . Then the computer would not connect with my print which is was working just fine prior to the update, I talked to 2 different AppleTechs ( I bought a service contract) 1 tech conversation was about the download issue  another tech was about the printer issue.They could not fix my problem. That was an all day ORDEAL.  Amazon is going to give me a refund."
3,Rolando Pizarro,5.0,"May 30, 2021",United States,Best iMac ever made!,"I ordered the iMac since the spring loaded event and it goes above my expectations. The screen is sharp, the colors are great (I got the blue one!) and the performance is blazing fast for my normal use as a college student. It’s simply that good."
4,Larry,5.0,"June 7, 2021",United States,It works flawlessly,"I have favored using Apple products over the years. My work life has given me the opportunity to use Windows products when it comes to laptops and desktops. I have also owned Windows laptops and desktops for home use in the past and will never go back to them for my personal use.I currently have a MacBook Air, iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, Homepods, Apple TV and now this new iMac which has replaced my older iMac. Apple ties everything together using iCloud. When everything works together it just makes life easy. With this iMac I have now stepped up to a SSD and that along with the new M1 Processor it makes this machine fast. Really fast.The migration assistance software that the iMac comes with allowed me to easily move everything over from my old iMac’s Time Machine backup. In no time at all I was up and running with my old desktop settings and all my Apps from my old iMac on this new machine. Rosetta 2 translates and runs a few Apps that are still Intel CPU coded.The 24 inch display is another plus for me. Beautiful colors and resolution.The fingerprint security on the keyboard is nice but my old iMac would unlock via my Apple Watch so it isn’t something that I would had to have.One negative is the ports. You either buy a USB Hub or like me purchase a few USB-C to USB Adapters to allow older devices to connect to the newer ports.I am pleased with it."
5,Michael U.,4.0,"June 11, 2021",United States,Love the iMac but have already had problems with it recognizing and mounting the mouse.,I have used the iMac for years and enjoy working on them. This one however has quit while turned off twice now and it takes several minutes to mount the mouse after I have restarted it. It doesn't work very well without a mouse.
6,Oregon T.,1.0,"June 11, 2021",United States,Worked fine for a couple days then BRICK!,Updated to newest OS - Worked for a couple days then went to power on and nothing. BRICK doing literally nothing...Sending back to amazon
7,Amazon Customer,5.0,"June 13, 2021",United States,Greta. Clean and Sleek,"If you can afford to, get the one with the most memory. However, I love this computer. It fits in to my space well. Just need a little SSD space."
8,CAtoAKgal,5.0,"June 14, 2021",United States,The feel of ease,"Both Apple amd Amazon strive to make it easy. The computer is great, functional and appealing. I chose to buy through Amazon bc I trust their shipping and ordering process more than anyone else. This is a very big purchase amd I was confident in putting hard earned money towards Apple and also Amazon where I feel extra effort and innovation is highlighted"
9,Ray,5.0,"May 27, 2021",United States,Refreshing green. Buy the base model!,..Unless you are a “pro” user utilizing high level software. I’m loving this model and don’t even feel like I’m missing out on Touch ID. But I’m not a fan of the Magic Mouse.. would’ve preferred if Amazon offered a Magic Trackpad upgrade like on the apple website for $50 but otherwise this was a great investment for the value.For folks in need of a desktop/family computer but who are also working in areas where space is constrained- this is an ideal  all in one package for you. I already feel attached to this mighty yet sleek piece of tech due to all the personalized color details and quick performance. No apple product is perfect but this one is certainly once in a generation type of hype after over a decade since the last iMac design update.**Update** After a few days getting used to the machine I love it even more! I’m surprised by the great selection of games compatible on the gorgeous Retina display. I did have to buy a cheap backlit keyboard for night work and hope for apple to upgrade their next magic keyboard with backlit keys…
10,Christopher,5.0,"May 28, 2021",United States,Excellent upgrade,It’s super fast and the screen is fantastic. Speakers and camera are some of the best I have used. I do wish I had gotten a full sized keyboard with numpad.
11,Jong Lee,4.0,"May 22, 2021",United States,Small footprint and light,"Nice machine and it is light. 24” is a bit small in my opinion. The amount of desktop footprint it takes is much less than the 27” previous gen version. I did find it annoying that the out of box setup requires to pair with the bundled keyboard and mouse. I swapped out both, especially since if you place the bundled keyboard on top of the base, it is metal on metal scraping.None of the written reviews talk about this, but the display can be tilted with a negative tilt angle a few degrees. And the glass is one continuous sheet including the chin. It is just a different color but still covered in glass."
12,smrtypnts,2.0,"June 12, 2021",United States,NOT a touch screen ))=,Very disappointed this is a very expensive computer oils great has basic features but after using a touch screen laptop for a fraction of this price I really thought I was purchasing a Las test model touch screen Mac . Touch ID is bs that’s on a keyboard does not allow u to share screen with other devices which would help excuse the investment it’s a pretty screen but feels Iike a massive down grade going back to needing a mouse all because they probably just want to sell touch pads ugh huge fail Apple
13,albert mead,1.0,"June 18, 2021",United States,Disappointed and discouraged in my new IMac,I have only had this $1600 INac for a couple of weeks and for what ever reason it just locks up. I am now on a first name basis with Apple Tech. Support. Not happy considering to s  ex nd it back. The computer I had for 14 years which is not an Apple worked just fine in all the years I ownyit. Very disappointed.
14,Joshua E. M.,5.0,"May 23, 2021",United States,Most Gorgeous iMac Ever,"Ordered on Apple website, delivered yesterday, this year's new iMac is just beautiful! I like the red one best! Not to mention the M1 chip, which can help me do a lot a lot than before!"
15,Robert L Powell,3.0,"June 19, 2021",United States,Not happy,Can't  get  it to pair with my old  computer.
